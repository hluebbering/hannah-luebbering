# I am an undergraduate student at Wake Forest University pursuing a B.S. in Applied-Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science. My topics of interest include science and medicine, as well as mathematics and data-driven applications for solving large-scale problems. I think Github is an excellent platform because it promotes collaboration and allows us to develop faster. I believe that growing and expanding consciousness’s scope and scale is the only way to ask the right questions and move forward. A quote from Arthur C. Clark perfectly summarizes my interest in technology, which said that “sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” And that’s really true.

# I’m from Leawood, Kansas, but unfortunately, I have never seen a tornado.
# My second home is in Colorado, where I love to hike and ski.
# I’m a dog lover who adores my three dogs Max, Pip, and Cubs.
# I love to read autobiographies about inspirational figures who aim to make the world a better place.

Hannah Luebbering is an Applied Mathematics and Computer Science student at Wake Forest University, seeking a career in software computing, data science, and related technologies. Topics of interest include science and medicine, as well as mathematical and data-driven applications to solve large-scale problems. Motivated to learn, grow, and excel in technology. A quote from Arthur C. Clark perfectly summarizes Hannah's interest in technology, which says that "sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." 

* Helps lead the Wake Forest Association for Women in Mathematics, which establishes various programs and workshops to mentor and support students in math and science.

* Works with the Wake Forest Statistics department to study data science pedagogy. This study deploys a module for a random experiment, which assigns students to tidyverse or "base" models to learn R.

* Loves to read autobiographies about inspirational figures who aim to make the world a better place.
