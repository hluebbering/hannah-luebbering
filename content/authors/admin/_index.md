# I am an undergraduate student at Wake Forest University pursuing a B.S. in Applied-Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science. My topics of interest include science and medicine, as well as mathematics and data-driven applications for solving large-scale problems. I think Github is an excellent platform because it promotes collaboration and allows us to develop faster. I believe that growing and expanding consciousness’s scope and scale is the only way to ask the right questions and move forward. A quote from Arthur C. Clark perfectly summarizes my interest in technology, which said that “sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” And that’s really true.

# I’m from Leawood, Kansas, but unfortunately, I have never seen a tornado.
# My second home is in Colorado, where I love to hike and ski.
# I’m a dog lover who adores my three dogs Max, Pip, and Cubs.
# I love to read autobiographies about inspirational figures who aim to make the world a better place.

# Hannah Luebbering is an Applied Mathematics and Computer Science student at Wake Forest University, seeking a career in software computing, data science, and related technologies. Motivated to learn, grow, and excel in technology. A quote from Arthur C. Clark perfectly summarizes this interest in technology, declaring that "sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." 


Applied Mathematics and Computer Science student at Wake Forest University seeking a full or part-time position in advance of attending graduate school. Motivated to learn, grow, and excel in data analysis, mathematics, science, and technology. Like Arthur C. Clark said, "sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." Proven success working in challenging, fast-paced, and collaborative settings.


* Helps lead the Wake Forest Association for Women in Mathematics, which establishes various programs and workshops to mentor and support students in math and science.

* Works with the Wake Forest Statistics department to study data science pedagogy. This study deploys a module for a random experiment, which assigns students to tidyverse or "base" models to learn R.
